Create a decentralized Web3 chat application named DeChat inspired by WhatsApp. The application will allow any user to connect their wallet and send messages to any other EVM wallet address. The smart contract should have no admin, meaning any user who connects their wallet will automatically have the option to send a new message. Users can input a recipient's wallet address, type a message, and send it. After sending, a chat list will display with a default fake human-like icon for all users. If the recipient connects their wallet, they can view the message and respond. The chat list should show wallet addresses (e.g., 0xabc...) with the default icon. Messages will be stored on the blockchain to ensure decentralization.

Users can also send images, which will be uploaded and stored on Pinata IPFS, and retrieved from there when needed. Additionally, users can send ETH by clicking a $ icon, entering the amount, and completing the transaction. When money is sent, a message such as "User A sent you X ETH to your address" will automatically appear in the chat. Both message and image functionality should be designed to ensure smooth, fast, and reliable fetching of data.

The frontend should replicate a WhatsApp-style UI but modified for our specific functionalities. It should support dark and light themes, be mobile-friendly, and include advanced animations for a modern user experience. Users who have not connected their wallets will see a simple landing page with a wallet connect button, using the WalletConnect API. The landing page design should match the theme of the application.

Ensure to include an .env example file for environment variables like smart contract address and Pinata IPFS keys. The application will run on the Sepolia testnet, and all features, including wallet connection, message sending, image upload, and ETH transfer, should be decentralized.


I want full frontend and smart contract code also add a ABI file for the smart contract.
